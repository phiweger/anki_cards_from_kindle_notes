"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 232","","Cognitive psychologists define habits as “automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues”: things we do with little or no conscious thought."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 242","","By mastering habit-forming product design, the companies profiled in this book make their goods indispensable."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 253","","Today, small start-up teams can profoundly change behavior by guiding users through a series of experiences I call hooks. The more often users run through these hooks, the more likely they are to form habits."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 264","","how-to manual for building habit-forming products."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 273","","These years of distilled research and real-world experience resulted in the creation of the Hooked Model: a four-phase process companies use to form habits. Through consecutive Hook cycles, successful products reach their ultimate goal of unprompted user engagement, bringing users back repeatedly, without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 281","","A trigger is the actuator of behavior—the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types: external and internal.8 Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an e-mail, a Web site link, or the app icon on a phone."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 286","","By cycling through successive hooks, users begin to form associations with internal triggers, which attach to existing behaviors and emotions."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 290","","Following the trigger comes the action: the behavior done in anticipation of a reward."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 294","","Companies leverage two basic pulleys of human behavior to increase the likelihood of an action occurring: the ease of performing an action and the psychological motivation to do it.10"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 298","","What distinguishes the Hooked Model from a plain vanilla feedback loop is the Hook’s ability to create a craving. Feedback loops are all around us, but predictable ones don’t create desire. The unsurprising response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn’t drive you to keep opening it again and again. However, add some variability to the mix—suppose a different treat magically appears in your fridge every time you open it—and voilà, intrigue is created. Variable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies implement to hook users;"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 312","","Chapter 4 also explores why some people eventually lose their taste for certain experiences and how variability impacts their retention."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 314","","The last phase of the Hooked Model is where the user does a bit of work. The investment phase increases the odds that the user will make another pass through the cycle in the future. The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 317","","the investment implies an action that improves the service for the next go-around."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 332","","Recently, a blog reader e-mailed me, “If it can’t be used for evil, it’s not a superpower.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 342","","Choice architecture, a concept described by famed scholars Thaler, Sunstein, and Balz in their same-titled scholarly paper, offers techniques to influence people’s decisions and affect behavioral outcomes."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 360","","REMEMBER & SHARE Habits are defined as “behaviors done with little or no conscious thought.” The convergence of access, data, and speed is making the world a more habit-forming place. Businesses that create customer habits gain a significant competitive advantage. The Hooked Model describes an experience designed to connect the user’s problem to a company’s product frequently enough to form a habit. The Hooked Model has four phases: trigger, action, variable reward, and investment."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 381","","The evening version of my morning run had triggered a behavioral script that instructed my body to carry out my usual run-related activities—all without mindful awareness."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 386","","Habits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating over what to do next.3 The brain quickly learns to codify behaviors that provide a solution to whatever situation it encounters."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 400","","Habit-forming products change user behavior and create unprompted user engagement. The aim is to influence customers to use your product on their own, again and again, without relying on overt calls to action such as ads or promotions. Once a habit is formed, the user is automatically triggered to use the product during routine events such as wanting to kill time while waiting in line."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 408","","In this book I refer to products in the context of businesses that require ongoing, unprompted user engagement and therefore need to build user habits. I exclude companies that compel customers to take action through other means."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 424","","Warren Buffett once said, “You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices.”4 Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, realized that as customers form routines around a product, they come to depend upon it and become less sensitive to price."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 429","","For example, in the free-to-play video game business, it is standard practice for game developers to delay asking users to pay money until they have played consistently and habitually. Once the compulsion to play is in place and the desire to progress in the game increases, converting users into paying customers is much easier. The real money lies in selling virtual items, extra lives, and special powers."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 444","","Viral Cycle Time is the amount of time it takes a user to invite another user, and it can have a massive impact. “For example, after 20 days with a cycle time of two days, you will have 20,470 users,” Skok writes. “But if you halved that cycle time to one day, you would have over 20 million users!"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 455","","A classic paper by John Gourville, a professor of marketing at Harvard Business School, stipulates that “many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 457","","Gourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine times better."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 459","","Gourville writes that products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 469","","As we will learn in chapter 5, users also increase their dependency on habit-forming products by storing value in them—further reducing the likelihood of switching to an alternative."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 483","","But like any discipline, habit design has rules and caveats that define and explain why some products change lives while others do not."
